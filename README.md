This repository serves as the initial platform for developing a mobile application designed to aid in identifying venomous snakes within the southern region of Brazil.

The primary objective of the app is to swiftly differentiate between venomous and non-venomous snakes in field scenarios.

We assume that most individuals can recognize a snake without requiring immediate species identification upon encountering one. However, the ability to swiftly assess its potential threat level is crucial.

Hence, the mobile app aims to assist users in promptly determining whether the encountered snake is venomous or not. Furthermore, for venomous species, the app intends to categorize the risk into three levels: Red (extremely venomous, posing a risk of severe injury or death), Yellow (moderately venomous, with less threatening effects on humans), and Green (non-venomous, though a bite may cause pain and potential infections).

We anticipate that this approach could prove particularly beneficial for wearable devices by incorporating a sound alert feature.

We encourage any contributors to engage by sharing suggestions and posing questions in the 'Issues' section of this repository. Your input is highly appreciated!
