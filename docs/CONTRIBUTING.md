# CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES

We owe a big thanks to the creators of (https://github.com/nayafia/contributing-template)[Contributing-template] for inspiring these clear and concise guidelines.

## Introduction

### It's truly awesome to have you here!

>First off, thank you for considering contributing to **Ophidia**. It's people like you that makes **Ophidia** such a great undertaking.

### Why you should read these contributing guidelines.

>Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### These are the kind of contributions we are always looking for:

> **Ophidia** is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! 
> The project is still in its early stages, so right now we're brainstorming and gathering ideas to chart its course. We're especially interested in finding high-resolution snake image datasets to train our model and build a venom vs. non-venom database. Any relevant scientific literature to support our decisions would be super helpful!
> While Python is currently the likely the core language for the backend due to its compatibility with mobile and wearable devices, we're definitely open to suggestions! 
> Check out the open issues and feel free to contribute – all ideas are welcome!  

In the near future we hope to have many more/ ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into **Ophidia**.

### What we don't actually need:

> Please, don't use the issue tracker for undermining the project. Be constructive.

## Ground Rules
### Set expectations for behavior (yours, and theirs).

> Responsibilities
> * Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
> * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

## Your First Contribution

> Unsure where to begin contributing to **Ophidia**? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
> Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
> Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
> Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

### Bonus points:
Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can access to guide help you contribute: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

> Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).
>At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:
>If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

## Getting started
### Here is a quick walkthrough of how to submit a contribution.

>For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

>1. Create your own fork of the code
>2. Do the changes in your fork
>3. If you like the change and think the project could use it, fire up your pull request!

### For tiny tinny fixes this is what you should do:

> Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch;
>As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
>* Spelling / grammar fixes
>* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
>* Comment clean up
>* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
>* Adding logging messages or debugging output
>* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
>* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

## How to report a bug
### Security first!
> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue or go tell the world about it, please. Email biofsdev@gmail.com instead, for obvious reasons. 
> Any security issues should be submitted directly to security@travis-ci.org
> In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at security@travis-ci.org.

### How to file a bug report.

> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
>
> 1. What versions of the core stack you are using?
> 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

### Our desired process for suggesting a feature is:
> Open an issue with the feature name.
> Explain why it’s needed and how it might work.
> If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in **Ophidia**, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that **Ophidia** will have will be added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

## Code review process
### How a contribution gets accepted after it’s been submitted.

> The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis during our triage meetings at Discord.
> After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

## Community

> You can chat with the core team on our WhatsApp group. 

## Labeling conventions:

> For now we do not hold labeling conventions for commit messages, neither for opening issues. We are going to go with the flow. Later, as needed, we might stablish refined rules.
