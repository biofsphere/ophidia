# DISCLAIMER

Hey there! Just a heads-up, our venomous snake identification software is still a work in progress. It's not near where we want it to be yet, so please remember:

> Any snake you find could be venomous, even if our software suggests it's not. Play it safe, folks!
> The opposite goes too â€“ just because our software says a snake is venomous doesn't mean it definitely is. Better keep your distance.
