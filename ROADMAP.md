# ROADMAP

After carefull consideration and assessment of literature available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09748.pdf and at https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0010647 we concluded the best course of action most definetly is to use machine learning to support the processo of disntinguishing our three classes. 

Therefore, the application database will most likey to serve only content to complement the information about snake species.

A Dataset is under development based on findings at https://reptile-database.reptarium.cz/advanced_search?taxon=snake&location=rio+grande+do+sul&submit=Search.
