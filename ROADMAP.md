# ROADMAP

After carefull consideration and assessment of literature available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09748.pdf and at https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0010647 we concluded the best course of action is to most definetly use machine learning. 

Therefore, the applicatio database will serve most likey to serve content and complement the information about snake species.

A Dataset is under development based on findings at https://reptile-database.reptarium.cz/advanced_search?location=Rio+grande+do+sul&exact%5B0%5D=location&submit=Search.
